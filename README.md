I'm an aspiring developer and CS undergrad with about 1 year left on the clock before my v1.0 release (Bachelor's Degree). 
When I'm not fighting segmentation faults in C++ or optimizing Java, I'm probably fighting bosses in Dark Souls. 

Thanks to everyone who takes a look at my page and checks out what I'm working on!
